# Recover a JishuDB MCP connection

Use this workflow when setup or a task encounters an unavailable connection.
Keep the user's intended machine and knowledge base explicit. A connection
repair is complete only when the actual host client can use that service.

## Establish the target before changing it

Inspect the active client entry and its actual source (user, workspace, managed
settings, or process override), with secrets redacted. Distinguish the machine
running the MCP client from the machine running this diagnostic agent: loopback
belongs to the client, not necessarily the agent's shell. Run local probes on
the intended service machine through an already authorized remote connection
when appropriate. Never substitute the diagnostic agent's own localhost.

Reuse a target already chosen by the user. Otherwise explain the current target
and observed failure, then offer only choices supported by the evidence:

- Use the existing local Desktop installation, if found on the client machine.
- Repair the configured remote service, or use another user-supplied remote URL.
- Set up Desktop if absent, or postpone this task while the owner restores access.

Recommend local Desktop only when the task calls for the local knowledge base
and the installation exists. A remote URL in old configuration is neither a
new user instruction nor proof of the wrong target. Do not silently switch
between databases, install another copy, or promise a connection before probes.
No answer means the target remains unresolved; elapsed time is not consent.

## Diagnose the failing layer

Use the endpoint-resolution and health-identity rules in [setup guide](../setup.md). Report the
observed error and next action; keep hypotheses separate from verified causes.
Retain sanitized exit codes, signals, elapsed times, and error causes where
available, never authentication headers or full environment dumps.

| Observation | Check and recovery |
| --- | --- |
| No host entry or wrong effective entry | Locate the configuration actually loaded by the client. Resolve overlapping scopes or overrides before editing. Offer a target choice if unresolved. |
| DNS failure, no route, or connection timeout | Verify the selected host and service reachability from the client. Ask for an updated address or restoration of the required network only when needed. A private IP or timeout does not prove a VPN or subnet cause. |
| Local connection refused | Resolve `desktop-endpoint.json`; check the installed app and listener. Start the existing app within the authorized scope and current user's desktop session. An SSH service-session process is not proof of a working desktop launch. |
| Desktop startup dialog or executable check failure | Inspect the exact bundled executable, manifest, launch context, and sanitized startup diagnostics. Distinguish missing files, identity mismatch, access denial, nonzero exit, signal, and timeout. A process or successful standalone version check does not prove Desktop started. |
| Health response is not JishuDB, redirects, or a protocol response is invalid | Stop credentials and writes to this target; resolve the intended service/path. Do not bypass identity checks or TLS verification. |
| `401` | Separate missing authentication from rejected credentials; do not guess expiry or revocation. Follow the advertised authorization flow for this exact target. |
| `403` or missing write tools | Distinguish origin/policy rejection from proven scope or KB-access insufficiency. Request the necessary scoped authorization; do not reinstall or infer privilege from a profile label. |
| Health and direct MCP probes work but host tools are unavailable | Check host-loaded URL, authorization, trust, transport, and cached discovery. Reconnect through the host; do not report curl-only success. |
| `429` or temporary upstream failure | Respect `Retry-After` and retry only the affected read-only probe within the bound below. |

Do not repair startup by opening Desktop SQLite in another service, replacing
bundled executables with system binaries, turning off security checks, or
raising timeouts without evidence. If a later launch succeeds but the earlier
cause is unknown, report recovery and that uncertainty separately.

## Apply the smallest authorized repair

Read-only diagnosis needs no repeated confirmation. Use existing authorization
for the selected target and repair. If a decision is missing, present the
concrete proposed change and its effect on which knowledge base is used before
requesting that choice. Installation, upgrades, data changes, and additional
privileges retain their own scope and presence gates from [setup guide](../setup.md).

Prefer the host's supported configuration UI or command. For an authorized file
edit, back up privately, preserve unrelated entries and permissions, detect
concurrent changes, and atomically replace only the selected entry. Re-read the
effective configuration; changing an unused file is not a repair.

When changing service identity, do not carry the previous target's manual Token
or OAuth grant to the new service. Remove a stale static Authorization header
from the selected entry with a protected backup; use the client's native
reauthorization for the selected endpoint. Do not read/copy OAuth tokens or
other clients' secrets. Validate metadata without credentials or redirects,
then offer browser OAuth when supported, with protected manual Token entry as
the explicit alternative under the existing authorization rules. Never click
agreement, OAuth consent, or device-owner prompts on the user's behalf.

Reconnect through the host's supported action and refresh its tool catalog.
If a restart would interrupt active work, explain the need and let the user
restart at a safe point. Do not terminate the host or edit conversation history
to force a reload. A required host action is `USER_ACTION_REQUIRED`.

After an observed recovery condition changes, retry the affected read-only
probe with a finite timeout, at most twice per unchanged failure in this task.
Do not repeatedly restart applications, reinstall, or reconnect with the same
failure. If a diagnostic connection drops, stop remote mutations and recheck
identity after recovery. Resume after a new user action or new evidence.

## Verify and resume the original task

Verify the loaded host entry, authenticated initialize, `tools/list`, and
`kb_get_capabilities`. For a write task verify write tools and access, then call
`kb_list` to resolve the intended KB on this service. KB IDs and permissions
from the previous service are not portable. Follow runtime-readiness checks
before importing; do not use synthetic writes to prove connectivity.

Resume the existing task with its original output directory and stable source
identities. Reconcile ambiguous prior writes through the original service
before retrying; do not replay writes blindly against a different database.
Existing local artifacts remain pending archival until the intended write and
readback succeed. If connection setup failed before generation, pause that
workflow rather than silently producing a local-only deliverable.

Report the verified endpoint and last successful layer. Use `READY` only after
actual host calls and required readiness pass; otherwise give
`USER_ACTION_REQUIRED`, `BLOCKED`, or `FAILED` with the exact outstanding action.
A valid saved URL, running process, healthy endpoint, and completed import are
separate observations.
