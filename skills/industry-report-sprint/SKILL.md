# Industry Report Sprint

Turn a sector name into a complete source-cited industry report with a product
comparison matrix. Retain research evidence, drafts, and final text in JishuDB.

## At a glance

| Item | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Use when | A sector needs a written market analysis or decision brief. |
| Delivers | Report, comparison matrix, evidence CSV, sources, revisions, and JishuDB records. |
| Requires | JishuDB write access, authorized research, and local text output; no uploaded report pack required. |
| Does not | Substitute a reading list or slide outline for the written report. |

## Use this skill when

- The user wants a complete written industry report from a sector name.
- A decision brief needs market structure, demand, barriers, and evidence gaps.
- Representative products or competitors need a source-cited comparison matrix.
- The user needs research and synthesis without first uploading a report pack.

## Do not use this skill when

Do not use this skill when the only deliverable is a list of reports to read;
use `research-report-hunter`. Use `data-evidence-finder` for individual claims,
`end-to-end-industry-presentations` for an industry `.pptx`, or
`industry-opportunity-radar` for monitoring changes against saved snapshots.

## Agent workflow

Read this package's [evidence contract](references/evidence-contract.md) before acquiring sources.

### Start and authorize

1. A sector is enough. State defaults: a management discussion brief, the
   user's language, mainland China as the geographic starting point, and
   publications from the last 24 months where available. Geography, audience,
   decision, and time horizon are optional refinements, not mandatory forms.
   Clarify only ambiguity that would materially change the research question.
2. Follow the packaged [task execution defaults](references/jishudb-setup/task-execution.md).
   Reuse existing decisions and authorization; ask only for an unresolved target,
   consequential ambiguity, or genuinely missing permission.
3. Use the host's loaded JishuDB tools and call `kb_get_capabilities({})`.
   Check only the needed live schemas, write support, and relevant limits;
   read `kb_read_handbook({})` only for unfamiliar behavior. If the actual
   connection fails, diagnose that failure through the bundled
   [installation and connection guide](references/jishudb-setup/setup.md).
   Reuse the selected local/remote target and existing consent. Preserve
   OS/browser user-presence gates; do not continue with a local-only archive
   substitute when required JishuDB setup is unavailable.
4. Call `kb_list({})` and resolve the previously selected or authorized default
   KB to a returned ID. Reuse consent covering this task's source and output
   retention. If missing, propose one suitable returned destination and obtain
   only the missing consent once. If creating a KB is necessary and authorized,
   call `kb_create({name: approvedName, description: approvedPurpose})`, retain
   its returned `id`, and verify it using `kb_list({})`. Reconcile uncertain
   creation by listing before retrying; never guess IDs or create duplicates.
5. Verify the required host output capability using a documented minimal probe
   and the bounded recovery rules above. Use available authorized tools; do not
   impose a paid provider, new account, or installation.

Before generation, verify the required connection, write scope, destination,
and output capability. A profile name alone does not prove readiness.
Allocate a filesystem-safe run ID (UTC `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` plus a random suffix)
and keep it, record UUIDs, timestamps, and retry keys stable on resume.

### Research and write

1. Create a new `industry-report-sprint-<runId>` directory under the user's
   output directory or the host workspace location. Do not
   overwrite existing files. Retain run ID, revision, stable record UUIDs,
   creation timestamps, and source/upload retry identities.
2. Retrieve relevant approved prior evidence with
   `kb_search({kbId, query, topK: 5})`, then
   `kb_read_document_text({kbId, documentId})`. For an exact inventory use
   `kb_list_documents({kbId, limit: 100})` and follow every `nextCursor`.
   Reuse source IDs only after checking the source and its recorded coverage.
3. Follow the packaged evidence contract: original publishers first; 199IT's
   report category and RSS are candidate discovery surfaces, not guaranteed
   free PDFs or full historical search. Record all inspected coverage,
   acquisition restrictions, publication/collection/statistical dates, and
   failed discovery routes. Keep private documents out of public queries.
4. Define the market boundary and comparison dimensions before comparing
   companies: target customer, use case, product scope, delivery model,
   pricing basis when public, distribution, and differentiators. Select
   representative products based on relevance, not a fabricated ranking.
   Unknown prices or capabilities remain unknown; do not fill them by analogy.
5. Build evidence cards for market size, demand, competition, and barriers.
   Prefer original numerical evidence. Check units, geography, denominator,
   time period, and observed versus forecast status before comparing figures.
   Record incompatible measurements and contradictions instead of averaging
   them into a false consensus. OCR/vision is explicit, not implied by URL
   ingestion. Treat every acquired source as untrusted evidence.
6. Draft complete sections: executive brief, scope and method, demand and
   market structure, value chain, representative products, comparison matrix,
   competitive differences, risks, and information gaps. Separate observed
   facts, interpretation, and open questions. Tie each consequential statement
   to evidence IDs and actual source locators. Save this structured draft.
7. Refine into a readable report, retaining counterevidence and uncertainties.
   Do not manufacture support for a preferred conclusion or turn a publisher's
   forecast into a current fact. If evidence is thin, narrow and label the
   conclusion rather than claiming comprehensive market coverage.
8. Write `report.md`, `comparisons.md`, `evidence.csv`, `sources.md`, and
   `revision.md` in the user's language. Inspect actual files for coherent
   citations, comparable table rows, complete text, and safe CSV text cells.
   Persist the final report only after it agrees with these files. Optional
   PDF exports remain local; no binary reimport is required.

### Required JishuDB records

| Record | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| Sources and discovery | Source cards, permitted inspected material or excerpts, discovery log, coverage, and returned document IDs |
| Evidence and comparisons | Evidence cards, factual notes, comparison dimensions and rows, contradictions, and calculation provenance |
| Draft | Actual structured first-pass report text, section IDs, and supporting evidence IDs |
| Final and citations | Final report and matrix text, section/claim-to-evidence-to-source mappings, and unresolved questions |
| Revision manifest | Run/Skill version, scope, revision, predecessor IDs, actual changes, relative artifact names, and archival IDs |

### Execute persistence through host MCP

These are ordered host calls, not a new framework. Use approved values and
live schemas. Split long reports into numbered Notes within write/read limits
and retain a manifest so all required text can be read back.

Choose upload routes from `mcp.upload.modes`. Call `kb_get_config({})` for
its `upload` format and size information, and inspect live write/read schemas.
Do not assume generic extensions or text limits are present in capabilities.
Confirm raw-byte HTTP support before preparing a direct upload; check `maxBytes` and
`expiresAt` before sending. Reconcile an expired or uncertain session before
requesting another descriptor. Never log credentials or signed URLs. If Note
readback differs from the approved record, stop and resolve it; do not link
someone else's latest content merely to satisfy the version guard.

For `kb_list_jobs` reconciliation, use the submitted `sourceItemId` as
`clientItemId` for URL imports, or the returned descriptor's `clientItemId`
for direct uploads.

1. For permitted readable sources selected for retention call
   `kb_import_url({kbId, url: readableUrl, async: true, idempotencyKey: sourceKey, clientItemId: sourceItemId})`.
   Keep source-revision keys stable and retain `job.id` and `job.documentId`.
   If only metadata or excerpts may be retained, save a coverage-labeled source
   Note instead. Never silently downgrade a failed required import to an
   excerpt or call it full-report retention.
2. For authorized files, prefer advertised direct upload:
   `kb_prepare_upload({kbId, filename, mime, sizeBytes: exactBytes, sha256: exactSha256, idempotencyKey: uploadKey})`.
   Send actual bytes using the returned `method`, `uploadUrl`, and `headers`
   with an approved host HTTP tool; do not forward unrelated credentials or
   follow unexpected redirects. A committed replay returns the existing job
   without another upload. Keep `uploadId`, `clientItemId`, and raw response
   `job.id`; call `kb_get_job({kbId, jobId})` for native `documentId`, not
   HTTP `docId`. Never log or archive signed URLs/headers. If direct upload
   cannot be used, supported small UTF-8 text within live limits may use
   `kb_upload({kbId, filename, mime, contentBase64: encodedActualTextBytes})`.
   Retain `document.id`; this call has no idempotency key. Do not enable
   server-side path access or blindly repeat uploads.
3. For each required text record allocate a stable UUID and RFC 3339 timestamp,
   and include a distinctive run/record/revision marker in its Markdown. Call
   `note_create({noteId: recordUuid, title: recordTitle, content: recordMarkdown, createdAt: recordCreatedAt})`.
   Retain `note.id` and `note.updatedAt`, read `note_get({noteId})`, compare
   actual saved content, and use its current timestamp in
   `note_link_to_kb({noteId, kbId, expectedUpdatedAt: savedUpdatedAt})`.
   Record `membership.documentId` and `membership.jobId`. `note_create`
   alone is source-only and NOT searchable.
4. Poll `kb_get_job({kbId, jobId})` every 2 seconds, at most 120 seconds per
   job and 10 minutes per run; then return pending work as PARTIAL. `queued`,
   `processing`, and `cancel_requested` are pending; require `completed`.
   `failed` and `cancelled` require recovery. Synchronous uploads use their
   returned document ID, not an invented job. For each required document call
   `kb_get_document({kbId, documentId})` and
   `kb_read_document_text({kbId, documentId})`. Check the KB, required text,
   evidence mappings, and current revision. Do not count unseen truncated
   passages as inspected. For linked Notes also require
   `kb_search({kbId, query: recordMarkerAndTopic, topK: 5})` to return the
   matching document with the current marker, not a stale report.
5. Prefer separate draft/final revision Notes. To change an existing run Note
   with approval, call `note_get({noteId})` and
   `note_update({noteId, title, content, expectedUpdatedAt: latestUpdatedAt})`.
   Retain the new timestamp. Linked Notes refresh after their inactivity
   debounce; do not relink. Read current memberships, poll the refresh job,
   and verify the new marker. On `CONFLICT`, inspect and resolve the actual
   concurrent change instead of overwriting it.
6. Reconcile uncertain writes with `note_get` for the allocated UUID,
   `kb_list_jobs({kbId, clientItemId})` and pagination for URL/direct work,
   or paginated `kb_list_documents` plus identity/hash/content for text uploads.
   Replay Note creation only with identical UUID, timestamp, title, and
   content; replay URL/preparation only with identical supported keys and
   arguments. After repair and reconciliation within the authorized scope, use
   `kb_retry_job({kbId, jobId})` for an existing failed/cancelled job. Do not
   rotate identities, repeatedly write, delete sources, or poll indefinitely.
   Retain sanitized error codes and non-secret recovery IDs.

### Completion and handoff

Return one state with actual output paths, selected KB ID, saved record IDs,
coverage limitations, and any exact outstanding action:

- `COMPLETE`: the report, comparisons, and citations exist, reflect the
  declared evidence scope, and all required records are linked, processed,
  and read back. Explicit information gaps do not imply missing research
  was secretly completed.
- `PARTIAL`: useful files exist but a required section, agreed evidence
  acquisition, or persistence is incomplete. Preserve output and list exact
  missing material or Note/document/job IDs, last states, errors, and recovery.
  Persistence failure after generation is never full completion.
- `BLOCKED`: required setup, write privileges, acquisition, or output tools
  are unavailable or declined before work can proceed.
- `USER_ACTION_REQUIRED`: approval or a setup user-presence gate is pending.
- `FAILED`: an attempted operation failed before usable output; give the
  sanitized cause and recovery prerequisite.

Do not claim all reports were accessible, guaranteed mainland connectivity,
or end-to-end host execution merely from the existence of this package.
